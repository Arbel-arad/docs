# Quick Start

This quick start allows you to get hands-on experience of Zerops, whether you only want to see it in action or want to start small and scale up the project size later. The purpose of this guide is to get an existing Node.js application up and running easily. If you are interested in more detailed guides for your own application, head to the [How to](/nodejs/how-to/create) section.

## Tutorial

As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a repository, a *recipe*, containing the most simple Node.js web application:
<DocCardList colSize={4} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: 'https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nodejs-hello-world',
    label: 'Node.js Hello World! app',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['github'],
    }
  }
]} />

:::tip
Follow the steps below and when everything is working as expected, fork the repo, try making various changes or be bold and connect your own.

:::note
In the detail of each step, you can find a link with more information about the topic.

</p>
</details>
<details><summary>3. Two pipelines are created, one for project creation and one for the service activation. Wait for both to finish.</summary>
<p>
Learn more about how the pipelines can be <a href="/nodejs/how-to/trigger-pipeline">triggered</a> and about <a href="/nodejs/how-to/build-process">build</a> and <a href="/nodejs/how-to/deploy-process">deploy</a> processes of a Node.js application in Zerops.

</details>
<details><summary>4. In the service detail, open the <b>Public access & internal ports</b> section, and <b>Enable Zerops Subdomain</b>.</summary>
<p>
Learn more about how to <a href="/nodejs/how-to/access">access</a> your Node.js service in Zerops.

</details>
<details><summary>5. Once the pipeline finishes, open the activated subdomain URL in your browser - you should see a simple page with <code>Hello World!</code> printed.</summary>
<p>
Congratulations! You have created your first application in Zerops, and we hope to see your own projects soon.
