title: Stop and start .NET service
---

Zerops allows you to stop any service. Stopped services only consume disk.

## Stop, start and restart .NET service in Zerops GUI
To stop the .NET service in Zerops GUI go to the project dashboard and select the **Stop** menu item in the top right corner.

**// TODO screenshot (show menu with the start and stop items on a service)**

To start the stopped .NET service choose the **Start** item from the same menu.

To restart the .NET service choose the **Restart** item from the same menu.

## Stop and start .NET using zCLI
zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To stop and start the .NET service via the command-line, follow these steps:
1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. Run the `zcli service stop` command  

```sh
Usage:
  zcli service stop [serviceIdOrName] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               the enable Zerops subdomain command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
      --serviceId string   If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```
You must enclose the `projectNameOrId` in quotes if it contains a space. The project name is visible in Zerops GUI. If you have more projects with a duplicate name, use the project ID instead. You'll find the project ID in the URL of the project dashboard page in Zerops GUI. <br/>E.g. <code>https://app&#46;zerops.io/project/<b>Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w</b>/service-stacks</code>.

3. Run the `zcli service start` command  
```sh
Usage:
  zcli service start [{serviceName | serviceId}] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               the service start command.
      --projectId string   If you have access to more than one project, you must specify the project ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
      --serviceId string   If you have access to more than one service, you must specify the service ID for which the
                           command is to be executed.
```
:::info
zCLI commands are interactive, when you press enter after `zcli service start`, you will be given a list of your projects and services to choose from.
