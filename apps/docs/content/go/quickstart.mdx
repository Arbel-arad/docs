# Quick Start

This quick start allows you to get hands-on experience of Zerops, whether you only want to see it in action or want to start small and scale up the project size later. The purpose of this guide is to get an existing Go application up and running easily. If you are interested in more detailed guides for your own application, head to the [How to](/go/how-to/create) section.

## Tutorial

As said, there is no need for coding yet, we have created a repository, a *recipe*, containing the most simple Go web application:
<DocCardList colSize={4} items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: 'https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-go-hello-world',
    label: 'Go Hello World! app',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['github'],
    }
  }
]} />

:::tip
Follow the steps below and when everything is working as expected, fork the repo, try making various changes or be bold and connect your own.

:::note
In the detail of each step, you can find a link with more information about the topic.
